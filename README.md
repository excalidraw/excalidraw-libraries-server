Automate the process of excalidraw libraries

# Development

1. Install [Firebase CLI](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools):

  ```
  npm i -g firebase-tools@9.12.1
  ```

  (Versions newer than 9.12.1 may not work, at least when deploying, which you probably won't do. YMMV.)

2. Start Firebase emulator:

  ```
  yarn dev
  ```
